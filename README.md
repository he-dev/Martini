; settings for database access
[database]
; use IP address in case network name resolution is not working
server=192.0.2.62     
port=143
file=foo.dat
file=baz.dat

[database]
server=192.0.2.68
port=146

[last]
foo=bar
```

Dynamic sections a properties retrieval:

```c#
dynamic iniFile = IniFile.From("test.ini");
var server = iniFile1.database.server; // = 192.0.2.68
```

Indexed section and properties retrieval:

```c#
var iniFile = IniFile.From("test.ini");
var server = iniFile["database"]["server"]; // = 192.0.2.68
var section = iniFile.AddSection("downloads");
```
